Sample Code
Example of this use case: The XML signature
verifier of the receiving system expects an XML signature as
shown in the following code snippet.The signature is a
detached signature, because the signature element is a
sibling of the signed element B. However, the receiving
system requires the enveloped-signature transform method to
be specified in the Transforms list. To ensure this, you
have to configure a detached signature in the XML Signer
step, then add a Content Modifier step before the XML Signer
step, where you specify the header
"CamelXmlSignatureTransformMethods" with the constant value

Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). For more information,
see:http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-parameters/http-parameters.xhtml#content-coding."
"Content-Type","Header","HTTP Receiver adapter
Mail Receiver adapter","HTTP content type that fits to the body of the request.
The content type is composed of two parts: a type and a
subtype.For example, image/jpeg (where
image is the type and jpeg
is the subtype). 
Examples:


text/plain for unformatted text


text/html for text formatted with HTML
syntax


image/jpeg for a jpeg image file 


application/json for data in JSON format
to be processed by an application that requires this
format

The list of available content types is maintained by the Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). For more information, see
http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml.
Note
If transferring text/* content types, you
can also specify the character encoding in the HTTP header
using the charset parameter. Here is an example of such a header:Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8The default character encoding that will be applied for
text/* content types depends on the
HTTP version: us-ascii for HTTP 1.0 and
iso-8859-1 for HTTP 1.1. Text data in string format is converted using UTF-8 by
default during message processing. If you want to override
this behavior, you can use the Content Modifier step and
specify the CamelCharsetName Exchange
property. To avoid encoding issues when using this feature
together with the HTTP adapter, consider the following
example configuration:If you use a Content Modifier step and you want to send
iso-8859-1-encoded data to a receiver,
make sure that you specify the
CamelCharsetName Exchange property
(either header or property) as iso-8859-1.
For the Content-Type HTTP header, use text/plain;
charset=iso-8859-1. "
